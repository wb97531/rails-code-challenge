## TODO

* Please utilize git and commit as you go!

- That last developer - they did a number on the seeds, please refactor them!
- For some reason the index page will not render after the orders are seeded...
- Sort the orders into 2 categories on the index page - shipped and not shipped.  Sort the shipped orders by shipped date.
- Add an order entry screen that allows creating an order with multiple line items.
- The expedited flag on an order can't be disabled once it's been enabled. Find and fix the bug.

* Bonus - Ascii art? (for Austin)
